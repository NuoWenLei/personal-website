## About the Project

This project started off as my final project for an IBM Data Science MOOC course. I used basic AI methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to try to predict COVID death trends.

My [**final presentation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyjopF7Bq7Q) is posted on YouTube, and it shows the process I went through to extract and construct the data as well as suggest a basic AI solution.


```{r, fig.cap = "https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/pictures/covid-github.png")
```

However, after the course, I wanted to see if I could create a way that produced better numbers in predicting trends, so I dove deeper into more innovative data-processing methods and documented my full process and results on [**this Github page**](https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme).
