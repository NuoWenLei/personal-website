Witnessing the coverage of George Floyd's death and the effects that followed, though I was stuck in Hong Kong, made me want to contribute somehow to the social justice movement. That opportunity came when a friend of mine reached out to me with the idea of creating some kind of website that could help the movement.

```{r, fig.cap = "Main page of the website"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/pictures/takeactionmass.png")
```

After some deliberation, we set a clear goal of making this website's main audience the people who want to help but don't know how to. The idea is to aggregate a lot of ways that people can help, allowing people who visit easy access to methods of contributing as well as sources to stay inform.

```{r, fig.cap = "News page of the website"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/pictures/takeactionmass-1.png")
```
