It kind of shows how my interests changed overtime from Computer Science to web design to data science and AI.\nI hope you find something interesting or just enjoy your time on this website!\nAbout Me\nI’m Nuo Wen Lei from Shanghai, studying in the 2022 class of Concord Academy, MA.\nI have an interest in Computer Science, Data Science, and Behavioral Sciences, and I like to play tennis, watch anime, and eat delicious food!\nGithub\nLinkedIn\nInstagram: nuowenlei\nDiscord: NuoWenLei#0308\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis project started off as my final project for an IBM Data Science MOOC course. I used basic AI methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to try to predict COVID death trends.\n\n\nMy final presentation is posted on YouTube, and it shows the process I went through to extract and construct the data as well as suggest a basic AI solution.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme\n\n\n\nHowever, after the course, I wanted to see if I could create a way that produced better numbers in predicting trends, so I dove deeper into more innovative data-processing methods and documented my full process and results on this Github page.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWith friends from an online AI course, Inspirit AI, we trained an AI to detect if a patient is experiencing epilepsy based on their EEG brain wave graph.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Output of AI shows its confidence in its decision while processing the graph\n\n\n\nWe were able to reach an accuracy of 89%, which is definitely not accurate enough to be used professionally. However, throughout the project we learned a lot about the ethical concerns surrounding AI’s influence on major fields as well as problems with modern-day AI’s explain-ability that discourage people to trust its results.\nIf you are interested, please do click here to try it out for yourself. Note that it does take a while to load because the AI model size is big.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis project started off as a personal challenge. During 2020, I took a lot of online courses through sites like EdX and Coursera ranging from web development to data science.\nI’ve made websites at this point, but I’ve never really applied my study in data science. This was essentially my first data science project.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Yahoo Finance page for the stock AXS\n\n\n\nUsing python and its various libraries, I created a simple pipeline to extract and analyze online data and then invest based on its results.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of investment pipeline\n\n\n\nData Webscrape - The pipeline starts by taking various numerical and textual data from multiple online sources.\nData Cleaning and Processing - The data is then cleaned for processing use since these online sources meant for the data to be presented to people and not machines. In this section, features like market cap values are also created based on their non-numeric displays on websites.\nInvestment Decision - Based on the data collected, each feature is assigned a weightage in the decision-making process, allowing each stock to be “scored”. Then the pipeline invests in the 5 highest-scoring stocks on an Investopedia simulator.\n\n\n\n",
