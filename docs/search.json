Here’s my tennis video\nVarsity Squash Number 1 in CA.\nMy Journey\nBefore 2020, my experience with coding had been in various kinds of sandbox environments. Inputs were cleanly defined and outputs bore no real meaning or weight. It was a low point for my interest in programming because nothing I made seemed to make a difference.\nIn fact, all the projects presented on this website were created after 2020. Because of COVID, our school swiftly adjusted to remote learning, however the quick transition left many teachers under-prepared for the curriculum. There were many long days with little to do at home, so I decided to take up online learning, starting with Harvard’s CS50x. That was the spark to my interest in programming.\nAfter completing CS50x rather quickly, I took the web development progression of the course, CS50w. In that class, I learned about both front-end development with HTML, CSS, Javascript and back-end with Flask, Django, and SQL.\nI was really excited after gaining this new-found knowledge because I was finally able to write programs that went beyond the sandbox. The first project I created was TakeActionMass in June 2020. Not only was it the culmination of what I had learned in the past 3 months, it also addressed a problem, it sought to make a difference. I’m really proud of it.\nDuring the process of making that website, I encountered various problems with both front-end and back-end. Back-end especially, I had to struggle through a lot of online database problems and understanding its limitations. This struggle actually sparked my interest in the manipulation and organization of data.\nIn September of 2020, as my Junior year started, I decided to also enroll in University of Michigan’s Data Science Specialization with Python on Coursera. It was a 5-course program, covering numerous topics including data processing, visualization, and machine learning models. I learned about various tools in Python that helped a lot with the understanding and processing of data, and also worked through different notebooks each about important problems.\nIt was also at this time that I started my investment bot project. Its main purpose is to automatically collect stock market data that I would be able to use in future projects, but I also added a simple investment simulation part just to see how well it can do.\nAs 2021 came along, I kickstarted my second Data Science specialization on Coursera with IBM, learning more about probability, data processing, and machine learning. As a final project, I wrote the analysis report and created the presentation on COVID death trends.\nIt was through these courses that my interest in ML and AI really grew. I began enrolling in extracurricular programs about AI, mainly InspiritAI, and I learned a lot about the concepts and implementation behind AI. By then, it was March, and I created and participated in various projects including: Epilepsy Detection, Mask Detection, Explorantine, WangWang, and Shanghai Property Analysis.\nThese laid the groundwork for my further exploration into the field of Data Science and AI during the summer of 2021. I enrolled in a Data Science course and created the PAC analysis website as well as contributed to the R tutorial package.\nThis is the story of my journey so far. As Senior year and college applications approach, I hope I can still make the time to work on these projects because it has really been a transforming experience.\n\n\n\n",

In this section, features like market cap values are also created based on their non-numeric displays on websites.\nInvestment Decision with ML - Using previously collected data, many different ML models are trained, each with a different model-scaler pairing. The pair with the highest evaluation score is selected to transform the new data. Based on the confidence level of the predictions, the pipeline invests in the top 5 stock symbols on an Investopedia simulator\n\n\n\n",

During which he reached out to me to ask if I’d like to work with him over the summer to help improve his R tutorial package, Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chapter 1 of the Primer\n\n\n\nI gladly joined him with a few other volunteers. I started off by just catching and editing small mistakes in the tutorials reported by users, then I got the opportunity to write the tutorial, Data Webscraping, myself. And afterwards, I was allowed to make some larger changes to tutorials in general.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Side navigation bar of the Data Webscraping tutorial\n\n\n\nFirst, I was assigned to add some quality-of-life features for better user experience. Then I helped make the process of creating tutorials more streamlined and simple by adding pre-defined templates and keyboard shortcuts to take the tedious work of writing each exercise individually off the tutorial-makers.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: My Github contributions to the package\n\n\n\nAfterwards, I worked on fixing a lot of the package’s technical errors while adding more addins that check and format tutorials. Also, a recent feature I am working on is creating a report of submitted answers for users to look at after completing each tutorial.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Sample Report\n\n\n\nAs the summer came to an end, I shifted towards working more on general class and assignment management programs. With Discord templates and bots, I built a class system that allowed classes to be organized and conducted over Discord in a similar fashion as over Zoom.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Class Discord Server Template\n\n\n\nAnd the final assignment management features I added were what I thought to be my greatest contributions to the package. Using R packages that allowed remote and automated access to Gmail and Google Drive, I created an assignment collection, organization, and summarization system. With a single function, my code was able to collect the submissions from someone’s Gmail, downloaded them, and aggregate user information such as name, email, and time spent. After processing the submissions, the aggregated data and submissions are uploaded to their Google Drive, allowing for easy access to the tallied information.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Class Discord Server Template\n\n\n\nIt was truly an amazing experience to work so closely with professor David Kane over the summer. If there is ever another chance for me to do meaningful work with him, I would gladly do so!\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAssociated Links:\nGitHub Repo\nWordle\nWordle Archive\nQuordle\nThis is a fun project I played around with over my senior year spring break. As the New York Times Wordle game took my school by storm, its simple format made me curious about the possibility of creating an algorithm to solve it. To start the project, I knew that I had to first create some interface for a machine to play Wordle, so, as pastime on a flight, I made a text version of Wordle. There is a small difference however. While the actual Wordle often displays words that are well-known to people, I made my Wordle simply randomly choose a word out of all possible 5-letter words.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Text Version of Wordle\n\n\n\nIn the text version, capitalize means the letter is in the right place, “*” means the letter is present but in the wrong location, and lower case means the letter is not in the word. I also added a “Possible Letters” bar for ease of playing.\nAfter creating the Wordle game, I began to think about how I would approach creating a Wordle solver. Part of me wanted to create a Reinforcement Learning agent to play the game, but another part of me felt that I’ve been doing too much AI-related projects recently. I settled on creating a non-AI algorithm that would probabilistically choose the optimal words.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Exploration of letter-location probability at the first position of a word\n\n\n\nI first made an algorithm that assigned information “rewards” to getting a letter correct (3 points), present (2 points), or wrong (1 point), thereby generating an information reward value for each word in the vocabulary. It then simply chose the word with the highest information reward. This algorithm created a machine that prioritized letters with a high probability of being in that position above all else. And while it did work to an extent, it was more of a Wordle “attempter” than a Wordle “solver”.\nNow if I really wanted to spin this into a story about personal insights and biases, this would be the moral of the story. I assumed that a letter in the correct place would always provide more information than other results, and in doing so I created an algorithm whose goal deviated from the overarching goal.\nTherefore, to improve the machine, firstly I changed the information reward as dependent on what percentage of the vocabulary the action would eliminate. For example, if getting the word correct eliminates half the vocab, its reward for being correct was 1/2. This is somewhat of a greedy solution because by evaluating the effect of each letter individually, I ignore the percentage of vocabulary that would be eliminated by the outcomes of 2 or more letters in the word. This overlap-elimination effect, however, is minimal, so I chose to ignore the flaw.\nSecondly, I added a bunch of conditionals to make sure that no information was wasted. I found that covering all the scenarios where a letter that’s present but in the wrong position was quite challenging. But one-by-one I found and covered all those edge cases. Finally, I set the machine to use the first 5 guesses to eliminate as much of the vocabulary as possible and then use the most possible word only for the final guess. This allowed the algorithm to truly “solve” Wordle.\nI then created a web interface for the machine to actually play the official Wordle. Using the Python module of Selenium, the Wordle solver (named Trish) could solve the Wordle live in front of your eyes!\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Trish solving Wordle for March 20, 2022\n\n\n\nIt can also solve any Wordle archived here.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Trish solving Wordle for March 20, 2022\n\n\n\nAs a final challenge, I created a separate algorithm that solved Quordle instead of Wordle (named Trisha) by simply adding up the information reward value that could be gained from every board and left the last 4 guesses for optimal words. And, well, as of now (March 20, 2022), it hasn’t failed yet!\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Trisha solving Quordle for March 20, 2022\n\n\n\nThis just started off as a fun project for over spring break. However, it not only helped me brush up on actual hand-coding, but it also taught me some good lessons about probabilities and my own assumptions!\n\n\n\n",
