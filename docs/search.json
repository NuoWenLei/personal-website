      "contents": "\nAbout the Project\nThis project started off as my final project for an IBM Data Science MOOC course. I used basic AI methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to try to predict COVID death trends.\n\n\nMy final presentation is posted on YouTube, and it shows the process I went through to extract and construct the data as well as suggest a basic AI solution.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme\n\n\n\nHowever, after the course, I wanted to see if I could create a way that produced better numbers in predicting trends, so I dove deeper into more innovative data-processing methods and documented my full process and results on this Github page.\n\n\n\n",
