I used basic AI methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to try to predict COVID death trends.\n\n\nMy final presentation is posted on YouTube, and it shows the process I went through to extract and construct the data as well as suggest a basic AI solution.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme\n\n\n\nHowever, after the course, I wanted to see if I could create a way that produced better numbers in predicting trends, so I dove deeper into more innovative data-processing methods and documented my full process and results on this Github page.\n\n\n\n",

However, throughout the project we learned a lot about the ethical concerns surrounding AI’s influence on major fields as well as problems with modern-day AI’s explain-ability that discourage people to trust its results.\nIf you are interested, please do click here to try it out for yourself. Note that it does take a while to load because the AI model size is big.\n\n\n\n",

Since small businesses were losing a lot of customers during the pandemic, we decided to make a web app centered around supporting local businesses. It allowed users to search for nearby businesses based on their mood or desired activities.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Main Page of Explorantine\n\n\n\nThe page returns a list of places that are near your location. However, since this is a proof of concept, there are a lot of rough edges and room for improvement with the results.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Main Page of Explorantine\n\n\n\nUsing Natural Language Processing techniques with NLTK and spaCy as well as the Google Places API, we were able to match moods based on user input and search for places nearby that fit the user’s desire. It was the combination of a lot moving parts but with 10 hours straight of working on it, we got it working.\n\n\nIn the end, we were able to not only win “Best Small Business Solution” but also “Best Overall”! It was extremely fun to work on this project with friends, and if the opportunity presents itself in the future, I’d gladly refine and hopefully publish this project to the world!\n\n\n\n",

During 2020, I took a lot of online courses through sites like EdX and Coursera ranging from web development to data science.\nI’ve made websites at this point, but I’ve never really applied my study in data science. This was essentially my first data science project.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Yahoo Finance page for the stock AXS\n\n\n\nUsing python and its various libraries, I created a simple pipeline to extract and analyze online data and then invest based on its results. Then I attached this pipeline to a web server that will run this pipeline every week.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of investment pipeline\n\n\n\nData Webscrape - The pipeline starts by taking various numerical and textual data from multiple online sources.\nData Cleaning and Processing - The data is then cleaned for processing use since these online sources meant for the data to be presented to people and not machines. In this section, features like market cap values are also created based on their non-numeric displays on websites.\nInvestment Decision - Based on the data collected, each feature is assigned a weightage in the decision-making process, allowing each stock to be “scored”. Then the pipeline invests in the 5 highest-scoring stocks on an Investopedia simulator.\nThe next step for this project is to integrate an ML or AI model into the pipeline, so that the pipeline can essentially learn and improve over time.\n\n\n\n",

I started off by just catching and editing small mistakes in the tutorials reported by users, then I got the opportunity to write the tutorial, Data Webscraping, myself. And afterwards, I was allowed to make some larger changes to tutorials in general.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Side navigation bar of the Data Webscraping tutorial\n\n\n\nFirst, I was assigned to add some quality-of-life features for better user experience. Then I helped make the process of creating tutorials more streamlined and simple by adding pre-defined templates and keyboard shortcuts to take the tedious work of writing each exercise individually off the tutorial-makers.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: My Github contributions to the package\n\n\n\nAfterwards, I worked on fixing a lot of the package’s technical errors while adding more addins that check and format tutorials. Also, a recent feature I am working on is creating a report of submitted answers for users to look at after completing each tutorial.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Sample Report\n\n\n\nI plan on working on this package for the entirety of the summer, so I hope I can create more useful and interesting features in the next month!\n\n\n\n",

It first started off as a small area analysis, but as my interest grew into Shanghai’s urban planning and as my direction of research became clearer, I scraped data from online property-selling sites to produce a map that visualizes different attributes of properties and their positions in Shanghai.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of district property colored by year of construction (red: old, green: new)\n\n\n\nUsers can choose what attribute of the property to visualize and gain an insightful overview of the city distribution.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of district property colored by average price per square meter (red: low, green: high)\n\n\n\nWith this map, I also considered stakeholders and their interconnectivity in this area.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graph of profit relationships between stakeholders in the Shanghai community\n\n\n\nOverall, I’d say this project in the scope of my school course was a success. Through this experience, I’ve learned that the world of urban planning is vast. This project has only glimpsed at the peak of the iceberg and if opportunities arise in the future for me to dive deeper into the hidden effects and influences of urban planning, I’d gladly pursue it!\n\n\n\n",

Therefore, we decided to make a WeChat miniprogram that does exactly that. We decided to create it as a WeChat miniprogram to reach a large audience because WeChat is the main way of communication in China.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Main Page of WangWang\n\n\n\nI handled the javascript backend programming to connect with the cloud database and my friend did all the styling and position for the frontend. As we continued the project, another friend joined us and designed the layouts for all the pages. We are still currently working on a development version, so unfortunately it is not usable yet, but we have created several features already.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Court Search Page of WangWang\n\n\n\nThe main feature is searching for courts near you, which gives you information about the court location and rating as well as how many people play there.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Profile Page of WangWang\n\n\n\nAnother feature we added is a personal profile page, which allows you to fill in your basic information for matching optimal tennis partners.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Calendar Page of WangWang\n\n\n\nA feature we are still working on is a calendar function, which will allow users to better schedule meetings as well as further filter players based on parameters like available time.\nThough this project is still a work-in-progress, I have high hopes for this miniprogram and I wish that in the near future I can also personally use it!\n\n\n\n",
