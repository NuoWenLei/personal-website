      "contents": "\nThis project started off as my final project for an IBM Data Science MOOC course. I used basic AI methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to try to predict COVID death trends.\n\n\nMy final presentation is posted on YouTube, and it shows the process I went through to extract and construct the data as well as suggest a basic AI solution.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: https://github.com/NuoWenLei/covid_tracking_by_state#readme\n\n\n\nHowever, after the course, I wanted to see if I could create a way that produced better numbers in predicting trends, so I dove deeper into more innovative data-processing methods and documented my full process and results on this Github page.\n\n\n\n",

However, throughout the project we learned a lot about the ethical concerns surrounding AI’s influence on major fields as well as problems with modern-day AI’s explain-ability that discourage people to trust its results.\nIf you are interested, please do click here to try it out for yourself. Note that it does take a while to load because the AI model size is big.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis project started off as a personal challenge. During 2020, I took a lot of online courses through sites like EdX and Coursera ranging from web development to data science.\nI’ve made websites at this point, but I’ve never really applied my study in data science. This was essentially my first data science project.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Yahoo Finance page for the stock AXS\n\n\n\nUsing python and its various libraries, I created a simple pipeline to extract and analyze online data and then invest based on its results. Then I attached this pipeline to a web server that will run this pipeline every week.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of investment pipeline\n\n\n\nData Webscrape - The pipeline starts by taking various numerical and textual data from multiple online sources.\nData Cleaning and Processing - The data is then cleaned for processing use since these online sources meant for the data to be presented to people and not machines. In this section, features like market cap values are also created based on their non-numeric displays on websites.\nInvestment Decision - Based on the data collected, each feature is assigned a weightage in the decision-making process, allowing each stock to be “scored”. Then the pipeline invests in the 5 highest-scoring stocks on an Investopedia simulator.\nThe next step for this project is to integrate an ML or AI model into the pipeline, so that the pipeline can essentially learn and improve over time.\n\n\n\n",

During which, he reached out to me to ask if I’d like to work with him over the summer to help improve his R tutorial package, Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chapter 1 of the Primer\n\n\n\nI gladly joined him with a few other volunteers. I started off by just catching and editing small mistakes in the tutorials reported by users, then I got the opportunity to write the tutorial, Data Webscraping, myself. And afterwards, I was allowed to make some larger changes to tutorials in general.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Side navigation bar of the Data Webscraping tutorial\n\n\n\nFirst, I was assigned to add some quality-of-life features for better user experience. Then I helped make the process of creating tutorials more streamlined and simple by adding pre-defined templates and keyboard shortcuts to take the tedious work of writing each exercise individually off the tutorial-makers.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: My Github contributions to the package\n\n\n\nMy next step is to work on improving instructions of the package as well as understand the reason behind some of the common problems that arise while making tutorials.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAs part of a school course about urban planning, I decided to analyze the surrounding area of where I lived. It first started off as a small area analysis, but as my interest grew into Shanghai’s urban planning and as my direction of research became clearer, I scraped data from online property-selling sites to produce a map that visualizes different attributes of properties and their positions in Shanghai.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of district property colored by year of construction (red: old, green: new)\n\n\n\nUsers can choose what attribute of the property to visualize and gain an insightful overview of the city distribution.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of district property colored by average price per square meter (red: low, green: high)\n\n\n\nWith this map, I also considered stakeholders and their interconnectivity in this area.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graph of profit relationships between stakeholders in the Shanghai community\n\n\n\nOverall, I’d say this project in the scope of my school course was a success. Through this experience, I’ve learned that the world of urban planning is vast. This project has only glimpsed at the peak of the iceberg and if opportunities arise in the future for me to dive deeper into the hidden effects and influences of urban planning, I’d gladly pursue it!\n\n\n\n",
